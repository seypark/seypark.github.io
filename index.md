<h3> Pose Estimation</h3>
The human body exhibits many important relationships between adjacent parts, as well as between parts and their neighboring background regions. In this work, we learn context-sensitive compatibilities for how neighboring parts are produced by the grammar, and how their geometries and appearances are related. Furthermore, we utilize a background segmentation model to reason about the contrast between ... \[[detail]()\]\[[pdf](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/papers/Conf_2013/Human_parsing_cvpr2013.pdf)\]

<h3> Human attribute prediction</h3>
Humans use numerous cues to recognize attributes such as gender. For example, hair styles, cloth types, poses and accessories affect the judgments of gender because global information about the human can be considered as a composition of local cues. In this work, as human use local information, we infer global information using local information. We design attributed and-or grammar... \[[detail]()\]
